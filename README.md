# Logistic Regression â€“ Threshold and Sigmoid Curve

This project explains logistic regression **step-by-step** using math and code to show how predictions and classification work.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- How to calculate `z = b0 + b1x`
- How to apply the **sigmoid function**:  
  \[
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
  \]
- How to apply a **threshold (0.5)** to classify predictions
- How to plot the **sigmoid curve** with Matplotlib
- How to calculate **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** manually
